Welcome, dear visitor! We appreciate your presence here and would like to take a moment to acquaint you with our Privacy Policy. It's a document that sheds light on how we handle your personal information with utmost care when you use this website and its related services.

# Information We Collect

1. **Personal Information**: Rest assured, we don't collect personal details apart from browser and system information. We've gone to great lengths to remove any personally identifiable information from our Analytics and Error Logging tools (more on those below). This includes visitors' IP addresses and even the fancy-sounding `server_name`, which refers to your computer's network name.

   1. **[Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io)** is our trusty sidekick for keeping track of pageviews and counting visitors. You might enjoy checking out the company's [delightful post about privacy policies](https://plausible.io/blog/privacy-policy-page#privacy-policy-examples), which inspired most of this document. We [publicly share analytics data](https://p.dgrebb.com/). For more specific details about Plausible's privacy practices, please see the [Third-Party Services](#third-party-services) section below. 

2. **Usage Information**: We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information ("Usage Information") automatically when you grace us with your presence at dgrebb.com. This includes your browser type, operating system, referring website, pages you visit, and the glorious timestamp of your visit.

# Use of Cookies

1. **No cookies here, and never will be!** If, by some freakish occurrence, you encounter a cookie on this site, please alert us immediately by sending an email to privacy [at] dgrebb.com. We shall take swift action!

## Cookies and Embedded Content (Videos)

1. We do our best to sandbox content embedded on this site. This is the best way we can help prevent third-parties adding unneeded cookies to your browser. _*However*_, if you do see cookies from other websites while browsing this one, there is nothing we can do (at this time).

# How We Use Your Information

1. **Personal Information**: Everything we collect remains anonymous and is anonymized before being sent to our dear friends, the third-party services like Plausible.

2. **Usage Information**: We merrily review Usage Information to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements, and gather anonymous geo-location information for aggregate use. This information helps us improve the website, monitor its performance, and enhance the overall user experience. We believe in giving our users an experience as smooth as freshly churned butter.

# Third-Party Services

1. **Plausible Analytics**: We rely on Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused web analytics tool that collects and analyzes Usage Information. Plausible Analytics doesn't use cookies and doesn't collect any personally identifiable information. The information they gather is stored on their own servers, and it's all subject to their privacy policy. To learn more about Plausible Analytics' data practices, we encourage you to visit [their website](https://plausible.io) and dive into their [privacy policy](https://plausible.io/privacy).

# Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information we collect. However, let's be honest, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We can't promise you an impenetrable fortress, but we assure you that we're doing our best to keep your personal information safe and sound.

# Disclosure of Information

There may come a time when we need to disclose your Personal Information or Usage Information to third parties. This would only occur if required by law or when we firmly believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served upon us, or investigate suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activities. We hope that day never comes, but it's good to be prepared.
